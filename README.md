# React-POAZoo-2
A more complex version of my first Zoo related React project. Tips and advice on Stackoverflow and YouTube were used.
Inspired by a blog design, the intention for this app is to have access to the animals that the zoo has. This gives visitors and potential customers an idea of the animals available to be seen, as well as the zoo's history and personality. I still have to learn more in order to give the app more features such as a gallery and more pictures or icons for the site to have character. Through the Post page, you can submit any queries you may have involving the zoo and its properties. The Contact Us page contains the various ways to reach out to the Zoo especially for bookings.
